# GetMsolRoleGroupMembers.ps1

I need to add creating and importing the O365 session to make this script more complete.

This script assumes you have already created and imported your O365 session.  It will export a list of all your Office365 Administrator Roles and the users who are assigned those roles and exports this information to a CSV file.

Disclaimer: This script and any content is offered "as is" with no warranty. While this script was tested and working in my environment, it is vital that you test it in a test environment before using in your production environment. I am not responsible for any outcome that arises from you using these scripts.
