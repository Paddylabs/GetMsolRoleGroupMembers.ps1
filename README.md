# GetMsolRoleGroupMembers.ps1

I need to add creating and importing the O365 session to make this script more complete.

This script assumes you have already created and imported your O365 session.  It will export a list of all your Office365 Administrator Roles and the users who are assigned those roles and exports this information to a CSV file.
